## Shortcut to reload mesh
`Ctrl + Shift + LeftClick` on any visible segment in 2D/3D to reload its mesh after an edit.
This helps avoid having to refresh Neuroglancer to see the new mesh.

NOTE: You may need to do this more than once because Neuroglancer cannot know if the remeshing process has completed.
## Additional Keybind to Complete Annotation
`Backquote` key (under `ESC`) can be used to complete an annotation.<sup>*</sup>

<sub>****This serves as an alternative control for when double clicking doesn't work.***</sub>

## Sharded meshes
You can now view datasets with sharded meshes ( Minnie65 / `minnie3_v1` ).
