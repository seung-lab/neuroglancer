# New Save System
* ***State is no longer saved in the address bar***
* Pressing "Share" provides **shareable links** and **uploads to state server** if available.
* **CTRL + SHIFT + J** - Save and Copy Shortened Link. *(Recommended)*
* CTRL + SHIFT + R - Save and Copy Full State (Raw) Link.
* CTRL + SHIFT + S - Save.
* Local changes are still automatically backed up, but you must Save changes to share them.
    * This saves the changes remotely.
    * **Share button will be highlighted yellow if there are unsaved changes**
* The share button has replaced "Post JSON to state server".
    * The share button will provide the JSON and State url.
    * If you do not have access to the JSON Server, only the State url will be provided.
* If localstorage cannot be used, local auto saves will not work with this system. In user preferences (⚙), enable Old-Style saving to restore the original saving system. The save button will still operate as normal.
