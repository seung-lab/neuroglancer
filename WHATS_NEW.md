# Timestamps for Segmentation Layers
* Under the graph tab, the new Timestamp field allows you to view segmentations at various points in time.
* Warning: Setting a timestamp will deselect all selected segments including those that are hidden.
* When viewing a segmentation layer in an old state, it will be highlighted and feature a red <span style="color:red">ðŸ•˜</span>.

    * Clicking the <span style="color:red">ðŸ•˜</span> will reset the layer back to the current time.
    * This will also deselect all selected segments of that older state.
