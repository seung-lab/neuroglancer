# Find a path between two points in a segment
* A new feature helps users find locations of mergers.
* For graphene segmentation layers, a new widget has been added to the "Graph" tab. It is labeled "Find Path."
* One can select the point selection button, select a source and target point and hit the check mark to request a path between the points.
* The ChunkedGraph server will then compute a path and it will be shown in Neuroglancer.
* One can imagine a workflow to break up complex mergers of labeling two points clearly in different segments, finding a path
between them, splitting them, and repeating the process.
