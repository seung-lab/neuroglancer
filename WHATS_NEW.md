# New Save System
* Saving is no longer saved in the address bar to improve performance.
* Local changes are still automatically backed up, but you must Save changes to share them.
    * This saves the changes remotely.
* The save button has replaced "Post JSON to state server".
    * The save button will provide the JSON and State url.
    * If you do not have access to the JSON Server, only the State url will be provided.
* If localstorage cannot be used, local auto saves will not work with this system. In user preferences (⚙), enable Old-Style saving to restore the original saving system. The save button will still operate as normal.
